After 1 year living on Dublin, Ireland i decided to share my experience and some advices to Ireland newcomers and people that are interested in moving to this country.

## Before Moving

After 5 years working for the same employer and after the last events that had happened in the Portuguese economy me an my wife decided that it was the time to try to build our life in a new country.

After one June weekend updating my Monster profile in the next Monday i started to receive phone calls from job agencies around Europe.

The job interview processes lasted in August when i accepted a proposal made by my current company. They hired me to work in a permanent Senior Software Engineer role based in Dublin,Ireland.


## Ireland Choice

 The Ireland choice was not hard but the arguments that seduced me were :

* A job in a different industry - Aeronautical Telecommunications
* Chance to new learn new things and work with leading technologies
* A huge cluster of International IT enterprises to work on with highly competitive remunerations and career prospects.
* A challenging multicultural environment workplace
* Fast-paced dynamic IT sector

In October of 2012 i arrived in the Dublin Airport coming from the sunny Portugal with a lot expectations and 2 bags of personal stuff for bear my first year in the country.

## After Arriving

In the first days, i spent most of my time doing the paperwork so for helping newcomers i created an ordered list of tasks, tips and advices that you shall follow in order to get everything done without to much rush.

1. Rent an apartment or a house and get a letter from the landlord saying that you live on the house (proof of address). Here is a list of websites to search for apartments and houses:
  * [Daft.ie](http://www.daft.ie/)
  * [MyHome](http://www.myhome.ie)
  * [Rent IE](http://www.rent.ie)

2. Go the **Welfare Office** in Parnell Street, Dublin and register your PPS (Public Services Number) with the proof of address and your passport.

3. Apply for a **Tax Certificate** with the form [Form12A](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/form12a.pdf) after receiving your PPS number on the post, it usually takes 5 work days after the registering. Fill the form an send it by post to your local Revenue Office.

4. Open a **Bank Account** on your preferred Irish bank to receive your salary.Be aware that the bank may ask you for a recommendation from your employer.
  * [AIB](http://www.aib.ie/)
  * [National Irish Bank](http://www.nationalirishbank.ie/‎)

5. Buy a mobile phone from a Irish mobile provider network because you may need it to call to some services, the list of Irish mobile phone providers:
  * [Meteor](http://meteor.ie/)
  * [Vodafone](http://www.vodafone.ie/)
  * [O2](http://www.o2online.ie/)
  * [Three](http://www.three.ie/)

6. If you coming from a South European country don't forgot to buy some warm clothes because the Winter is long, cold and rainy.

## Overall Experience

The overall experience in Ireland has been very delightful and the most part of the people are kindly and helpful but i am still adapting to Irish culture and weather.

The city is environment is vibrant so you can find a lot of historical and funny places to visit on the weekends.

If you planning to move to Ireland first try get a job, save some money for the relocation expenses and compare the cost of living and taxes with your city in order to properly negotiate your salary.
