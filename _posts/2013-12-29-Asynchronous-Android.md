The awesome book by Steve Liles that i have been reviewing in the lasts months for Packt Publishing is available on stores.

Asynchronous Android is a step-by-step guide that builds a complete picture of the concurrency constructs available on the Android platform.

With this book you'll learn how to use AsyncTask correctly to perform operations in the background, keeping user interfaces running smoothly while avoiding treacherous memory leaks. It will also help you discover Handler, HandlerThread, and Looper, the related and fundamental building blocks of asynchronous programming in Android

Thanks to everyone involved in the project.
